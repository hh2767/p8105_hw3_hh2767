Problem 1
=========

Data cleaning
-------------

``` r
brfss = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010)
colnames(brfss)[2] = "location_abbr"
colnames(brfss)[3] = "location_desc"
brfss = brfss %>% 
   filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

Answering questions
-------------------

### question 1

``` r
  filter(brfss, year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(location_abbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(location_desc)) %>% 
  filter(n_location == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   location_abbr n_location
    ##   <chr>              <int>
    ## 1 CT                     7
    ## 2 FL                     7
    ## 3 NC                     7

From the result above, we know that in 2002, Connecticut, Florida, and North Carolina were observed at 7 locations.

### question 2

``` r
brfss %>% 
  group_by(year, location_abbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(location_desc)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_location, color = location_abbr)) +
  labs(title = "number of locations observed", y = "number of locations") +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  theme_bw() + viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Location", 
    discrete = TRUE
  )
```
